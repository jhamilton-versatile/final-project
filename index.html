        <h1>My Top 10 Favorite Movies</h1>
        
        <p>As a kid, my favorite movies were from Disney. They helped me overcome anxiety from social interactions that I still sometimes struggle with. The stories and characters were relatable to me as I'm sure they are for you. Plus, who doesn't love musicals?! I grew up as a 90's kid so it should come as no surprise that most of these films are from the late 80's - early 90's eras.</p>
